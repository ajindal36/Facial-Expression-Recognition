# Facial Expression Recognition
It is made using CNN, Tensor flow, haar cascade, Numpy and cv2

## REQUIREMENTS

1. Numpy==1.15.4
2. Ppencv-python==3.4.1
3. Tensorflow==1.12.0
4. Tflearn==0.3.2

## USAGE

If you want to train the model yourself you can get the orignal fer model from https://www.kaggle.com/deadskull7/fer2013.

If you want to use my pre-trained model you can get it from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Htb-GJ-o1NI__0zlJJhFnCmqBfjhWVGh/view.

The pre-trained zip folder will contain 3 files which you need to extract to the main folder containing the uploaded files.
