#**Facial Expression Recognition**
It is made using CNN, Tensor flow, haar cascade, Numpy and cv2

##**REQUIREMENTS**

Numpy==1.15.4

Ppencv-python==3.4.1

Tensorflow==1.12.0

Tflearn==0.3.2

##**USAGE**

If you want to train the model yourself you can get the orignal fer model from https://www.kaggle.com/deadskull7/fer2013.

If you want to use my pre-trained model you can get it from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Htb-GJ-o1NI__0zlJJhFnCmqBfjhWVGh/view.

The pre-trained zip folder will contain 3 files which you need to extract to the main folder containing the uploaded files.
